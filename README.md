# Climate
These scripts were developed on the base of R2018b version of MatLab. *EquillibrationsD2.m* produces the video with the visualisation of system's saturation in two-dimensional phenotypic space. Files *st_stateD^_100.txt* contain data of 100 saturated systems in three dimensionalities of the phenotypic space respectively. Each row of the table in *st_state* corresponds to single saturated system. The way of system's conditions storage in *st_state* is described in the start of *AdaptationD2.m* script, which takes initial conditions from the *st_state* file and produces the video with the visualisation of system's adaptation to the motion of CCC in two-dimensional phenotypic space.

To run the script all functions (*capacityD_cl, competitionD_cl, PopulDens_cl, Phenotypes_cl*) should be present in a working path.
